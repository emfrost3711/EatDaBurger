# EatDaBurger

This app uses handlebars, express and a custom-built ORM to allow users to add their favorite burgers to a menu, devour burgers, and remove burgers from the menu. Once you devour a burger, you can add the burger back to the menu. Once you remove a burger, it's gone forever -- unless you decide to submit that same burger again. 

Do you want fries with that?
